# H-E-B Locations Map

The H-E-B Locations Map project uses the Leaflet library to create an interactive map that shows the locations of H-E-B stores in Austin, TX. Each store is marked on the map with a marker, and clicking on a marker displays a pop-up with the store's name and address.

## Getting Started

To view the map, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The map will display the locations of H-E-B stores on an OpenStreetMap base layer.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the map and required scripts.
- `style.css`: Contains CSS styles for styling the map container and pop-up content.
- `data.js`: Contains the GeoJSON data for H-E-B store locations.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the interactive map.
3. Click on the markers to see the names and addresses of H-E-B stores.
